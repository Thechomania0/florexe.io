# Florexe.io

A tank-based .io game combining elements of **Diep.io**, **Scenexe.io**, and **Florr.io**. https://thechomania0.github.io/florexe.io/

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
2. Choose a gamemode: **FFA**, **2TDM**, **4TDM**, or **Heaven**.
3. **WASD** to move, **mouse** to aim.
4. Destroy shapes (food) to gain XP, level up, and collect upgrade drops.
5. Click inventory items to equip Body and Tank upgrades.
6. Collect 5 of the same upgrade, then **Craft** to attempt upgrading rarity.

## Rarities (Common → Super)

- Common (gray) → Uncommon (green) → Rare (blue) → Epic (purple) → Legendary (orange) → Mythic (red) → Ultra (cyan) → Super (yellow)

## Body Upgrades

| Upgrade | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Inferno** | Damaging ring around you, heals teammates |
| **Ziggurat** | +HP, damage reduction, -10% speed |
| **Cutter** | +Speed, +Attack, -20% HP |
| **Hive** | Auto-aiming drones |

## Tank Upgrades

| Upgrade | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Destroyer** | Big slow bullet |
| **Anchor** | Throws square turrets |
| **Riot** | 3 stacked square turrets |
| **Overlord** | Controllable drones (follow mouse) |

## Food Shapes

Triangles (common) → Squares → Pentagons → Hexagons → Septagons → Octagons → Nonagons → Decagons (super). Bigger shapes = more HP, more damage on collision, better drops.

## Crafting

Combine 5 of the same upgrade (e.g. 5 Common Destroyers). Success rates: Common→Uncommon 60%, then decreasing. On failure, lose 1–4 of the 5 items. Hold **Shift+Click** for mass-craft (future).
